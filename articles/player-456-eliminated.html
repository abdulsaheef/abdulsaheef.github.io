      <p>I first noticed <em>Squid Game</em> popping up on Netflix sometime around 2021 or 2022. That now-iconic poster — masked soldiers in pink suits — was hard to miss. But honestly, I wasn’t tempted. It looked like a Korean twist on <em>Money Heist</em> at first glance, and I wasn’t in the mood for what felt like another trendy imitation.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t until mid-2024 that I finally gave it a chance. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe I just wanted to understand the global obsession. So I hit <strong>Play</strong>. And I didn’t expect what followed: something this emotionally intense, visually strange, and <em>socially layered</em>.</p>

      <h2>🟩 2. The Start of the Game</h2>
      <p>One random day in 2024, I pressed play. I don’t even know why. Maybe it was just years of seeing that title float in my feed. Maybe I just gave in.</p>

      <p>The first few minutes felt like a typical Korean drama. A man falling apart. Gi-hun — broke, divorced, barely holding on to his daughter, and gambling away what little he had left. The scenes were slow. Almost frustrating. Just a spiral of helplessness.</p>

      <p>Then the subway scene hit.</p>

      <p>A sharply dressed stranger approaches him with a game — flipping paper tiles on the floor. I had never seen this before. Not in my childhood, not in my culture. But it was hypnotic. Every failed try came with a brutal slap. And the man taking those hits kept coming back.</p>

      <p><em>That slap wasn’t just pain — it was the entry fee into something darker.</em></p>

      <h2>🟥 3. Red Light, Green World</h2>
      <p>From the card to the van, then that white dorm full of strangers in green tracksuits — I was fully in. The rules? Simple. The surroundings? Not so much. Everything felt like a <strong>twisted experiment</strong> in control.</p>

      <p>Then came the first game: <strong>Red Light, Green Light</strong>. And suddenly, everything changed.</p>

      <p>Gunshots. Panic. Blood. People collapsing in waves. But what shook me the most wasn’t the killing — it was how <em>quickly</em> survival became strategy.</p>

      <p>This wasn’t a game about winning. It was about how broken the real world must be if this place felt like a better chance.</p>

      <p>The marbles round? Devastating. Trust shattered. Souls crushed. And that twist with Player 001… hollowed me out completely.</p>

      <h2>🔍 4. Behind the Curtain</h2>
      <p>The VIPs. The masks. The "entertainment" angle. It made me feel like we’re all in some version of that game every day. Maybe not with bullets — but with pressure, debt, and obedience.</p>

      <p>Gi-hun changed. Even when he walked out with the money — he didn’t win. His soul had already been bled out.</p>

      <h2>🟥 5. No Break, Just Descent</h2>
      <p>I didn’t stop between seasons. It felt like one continuous spiral. Gi-hun never left the game — not really. And when he walked away from that plane and dyed his hair red… it wasn’t drama. It was war.</p>

      <h2>🟥 6. Into the Game Again</h2>
      <p>He re-entered. Not as a player. As a disruptor.</p>

      <p>The new games were colder. Psychological. Designed to measure not just performance, but <strong>character</strong>. Mercy became a tactic. Cruelty, a shortcut.</p>

      <p>The silence before the rounds. The staring. The regrets. The weight of humanity shrinking down into every footstep on that glass path… I couldn’t look away.</p>

      <h2>🟥 7. The Final Rounds</h2>
      <p>The final round didn’t feel like a climax. It felt like a confession. Gi-hun didn’t face an opponent. He faced everything the system had turned him into.</p>

      <p>The expression on his face said everything. Rage, grief, guilt. And finally — <em>clarity</em>.</p>

      <h2>❌ 8. The Final Elimination</h2>
      <p>He walked away once more. But this time, awake. Changed. Not broken — but aware.</p>

      <blockquote>“<strong>Player 456, Eliminated.</strong>”</blockquote>

      <p>No gunshot. No blood. Just silence. The declaration that Gi-hun, the only one who remembered it all, was no longer needed.</p>

      <p>That line echoed in my mind for minutes.  
      Not because he died —  
      But because he was <em>erased</em>.</p>

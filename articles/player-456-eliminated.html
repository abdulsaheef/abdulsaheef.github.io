      <p class="post-subtitle">What I felt after watching all 3 seasons of Netflix’s <em>Squid Game</em></p>

      <p>I first noticed <em>Squid Game</em> popping up on Netflix sometime around 2021 or 2022. That now-iconic poster with masked soldiers in pink suits was hard to miss. But honestly, I wasn’t tempted. It felt like a Korean twist on <em>Money Heist</em> at first glance, and I didn’t want to jump into something that looked like a trendy imitation.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t until mid-2024 that I finally gave it a chance. Maybe it was curiosity… or maybe I just wanted to know what all the global hype was about. And when I hit “Play,” I didn’t expect to be pulled into something this emotionally intense, visually strange, and socially layered.</p>

      <h2>2. The Start of the Game</h2>
      <p>One random day in 2024, I pressed Play. I still don’t know why. Maybe it was just curiosity — the kind that builds up after years of seeing something constantly pop up in your feed but never grabbing your interest.</p>

      <p>As the episode started, it felt like any other Korean drama at first. A middle-aged man losing everything good in life. Gi-hun was broke, struggling, divorced, and about to lose even the small relationship he had with his daughter. The scenes were slow, even frustrating at moments. I felt like I was just watching a man spiraling downward with no hope.</p>

      <p>But then, suddenly — the subway scene.</p>

      <p>A well-dressed man walks toward Gi-hun and casually asks him to play a game. He pulls out two colorful paper tiles and places them on the ground. I didn’t even understand what that game was — I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. In my country, we don’t play games like this. But it was fascinating.</p>

      <p>Gi-hun tries it. He fails. He gets slapped — hard. Then again. And again.</p>

      <p><em>That slap wasn’t just pain — it was the entry fee to something much, much darker.</em></p>

      <h2>3. Red Light, Green Light</h2>
      <p>And I followed him — through the card, the van, and straight into that eerie white dorm with 455 other strangers in green tracksuits. The rules were simple, but nothing else was. The masks, the cameras, the silence… it all felt like a dystopian game show run by a faceless god.</p>

      <p>Then came the first official game — Red Light, Green Light. It was chilling. The oversized doll. The robotic voice. The gunshots that came without hesitation. That moment was my turning point as a viewer. The pace of the show flipped in seconds — from slow emotional buildup to raw panic, and it didn’t let up.</p>

      <p>What shocked me the most wasn’t just the violence. It was the reaction of the players. The way panic dissolved into desperation, then into strategy. These people were not just victims — they were survivors. Many of them chose to come back. And that told me this show was not just about games, but about how broken the outside world really was for them.</p>

      <p>I started getting attached — to Gi-hun, sure, but also to Ali, Sae-byeok, even Sang-woo. Each one had their own moral breaking point, and watching those lines blur was painful. The marbles game still haunts me. The way betrayal and sacrifice collided in that round felt so personal. It wasn’t just survival. It was losing your own soul piece by piece.</p>

      <h2>4. Behind the Curtain</h2>
      <p>The front man. The VIPs. The underground world watching it all as entertainment — it made me feel sick. I realized the show wasn’t just Korean fiction. It was global reality disguised as drama. We may not play to the death, but in real life too, people fight over crumbs while the elite watches from above.</p>

      <p>And yet, through all that, I held onto Gi-hun. His choices. His pain. His refusal to become entirely like the system. His hair may have changed by the final episode, but you could tell: he didn’t win anything. Not truly. He survived, but he lost more than he ever imagined.</p>

      <p>The final twist with the old man — Player 001 — left me stunned. I didn’t know whether to be angry or just… hollow. It reframed everything. And it also made one thing very clear:</p>

      <p><strong>This wasn’t a show about winning. It was a mirror. And what it reflected wasn’t pretty.</strong></p>

      <h2>5. No Break, Just Descent</h2>
      <p>I didn’t stop between seasons. It felt like one long echo — the sound of Gi-hun being pulled back into a place he never truly escaped.</p>

      <p>It started with the airport. He was finally going to leave. To go see his daughter. A chance at peace.</p>

      <p>But that phone call — the voice — it wasn’t just bait. It was a reminder that the game never ended. And Gi-hun, who once clawed his way out, turned around. Walked away from his family, his flight, his freedom…</p>

      <p>Not because he wanted revenge. But because he couldn’t ignore it anymore.</p>

      <h2>6. Reentry with Red Hair</h2>
      <p>He dyed his hair red. Not for fashion — for war. He was done being a player. Now, he was a disruptor. He didn’t beg. He didn’t fear. He just moved — straight back into the belly of the beast.</p>

      <p>The games evolved too. They weren’t just physical anymore — they were psychological. Designed to test not just survival, but morality. Mercy became a liability. Compassion got you killed.</p>

      <p>There were moments where characters stared across the room, already knowing one of them wouldn’t survive the next round. Those silences were louder than gunfire. And watching Gi-hun try to hold onto his humanity in that — that’s where the real horror lived.</p>

      <p>He sat still in one scene — emotionless. No words. No plan. Just presence. And I thought: he’s already dead inside.</p>

      <h2>7. The Final Rounds</h2>
      <p>The glass path. The silent falls. The split-second decisions. The regrets.</p>

      <p>By the end, I didn’t even want anyone to win. I just wanted it to stop. To let someone walk out whole.</p>

      <p>But the last game wasn’t about opponents. It was Gi-hun facing what the game had made of him. There was a moment — a close-up — where I saw a hundred emotions explode behind his eyes. And no words were needed.</p>

      <h2>8. The Silence</h2>
      <blockquote><strong>“Player 456, Eliminated.”</strong></blockquote>

      <p>No gunshot. No blood. Just silence.</p>

      <p>That wasn’t a death. That was erasure. Of identity. Of memory. Of resistance.</p>

      <p>That moment lingered. It still does. Because in that final declaration, the system won — not with violence. But with quiet deletion.</p>

      <h2>First Impressions: The Hype and Curiosity</h2>
      <p>I first noticed <em>Squid Game</em> popping up on Netflix sometime around 2021 or 2022 — that now-iconic poster with masked soldiers in pink suits was hard to miss. But honestly, I wasn’t tempted. It felt like a Korean twist on <em>Money Heist</em> at first glance, and I didn’t want to jump into something that looked like a trendy imitation.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until mid-2024 that I finally gave it a chance. Maybe it was curiosity… or maybe I just wanted to know what all the global hype was about. And when I hit “Play,” I didn’t expect to be pulled into something this emotionally intense, visually strange, and socially layered.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Season 1: From Normal Drama to Dystopian Game</h2>
      <h3>Pressing Play — A Slow Start</h3>
      <p>One random day in 2024, I pressed Play. I still don’t know why. Maybe it was just curiosity — the kind that builds up after years of seeing something constantly pop up in your feed but never grabbing your interest.</p>
      <p>As the episode started, it felt like any other Korean drama at first. A middle-aged man losing everything good in life. Gi-hun was broke, struggling, divorced, and about to lose even the small relationship he had with his daughter. The scenes were slow, even frustrating at moments. I felt like I was just watching a man spiraling downward with no hope.</p>

      <h3>The Subway Scene: The Game Begins</h3>
      <p>But then, suddenly — the subway scene.</p>
      <p>A well-dressed man walks toward Gi-hun and casually asks him to play a game. He pulls out two colorful paper tiles and places them on the ground. I didn’t even understand what that game was — I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. In my country, we don’t play games like this. But it was fascinating.</p>
      <p>Gi-hun tries it. He fails. He gets slapped — hard. Then again. And again.</p>
      <p>I literally said to myself: “WTF is going on?”</p>
      <p>The man wasn’t threatening, but his body language… calm, polished, quietly dominant. It wasn’t just a game — it was a test. A mental trap disguised as fun. That moment made me realize: this show is not about what it looks like on the surface.</p>
      <p><em>That slap wasn’t just pain — it was the entry fee to something much, much darker.</em></p>

      <h3>Into the Game: The Dorm and Red Light, Green Light</h3>
      <p>And I followed him — through the card, the van, and straight into that eerie white dorm with 455 other strangers in green tracksuits. The rules were simple, but nothing else was. The masks, the cameras, the silence… it all felt like a dystopian game show run by a faceless god.</p>
      <p>Then came the first official game — Red Light, Green Light. It was chilling. The oversized doll. The robotic voice. The gunshots that came without hesitation. That moment was my turning point as a viewer. The pace of the show flipped in seconds — from slow emotional buildup to raw panic, and it didn’t let up.</p>

      <h3>The Players: From Victims to Survivors</h3>
      <p>What shocked me the most wasn’t just the violence. It was the reaction of the players. The way panic dissolved into desperation, then into strategy. These people were not just victims — they were survivors. Many of them chose to come back. And that told me this show was not just about games, but about how broken the outside world really was for them.</p>
      <p>I started getting attached — to Gi-hun, sure, but also to Ali, Sae-byeok, even Sang-woo. Each one had their own moral breaking point, and watching those lines blur was painful. The marbles game still haunts me. The way betrayal and sacrifice collided in that round felt so personal. It wasn’t just survival. It was losing your own soul piece by piece.</p>

      <h3>The Dark Reality Behind the Games</h3>
      <p>The front man. The VIPs. The underground world watching it all as entertainment — it made me feel sick. I realized the show wasn’t just Korean fiction. It was global reality disguised as drama. We may not play to the death, but in real life too, people fight over crumbs while the elite watches from above.</p>
      <p>And yet, through all that, I held onto Gi-hun. His choices. His pain. His refusal to become entirely like the system. His hair may have changed by the final episode, but you could tell: he didn’t win anything. Not truly. He survived, but he lost more than he ever imagined.</p>

      <h3>The Final Twist of Season 1</h3>
      <p>The final twist with the old man — Player 001 — left me stunned. I didn’t know whether to be angry or just… hollow. It reframed everything. And it also made one thing very clear:</p>
      <p><strong>This wasn’t a show about winning. It was a mirror.<br>
      And what it reflected wasn’t pretty.</strong></p>

      <h2>Season 2: The Game Evolves, The Pain Deepens</h2>
      <p>When Season 2 started, I wasn’t sure what to expect.</p>
      <p>To be honest, after the sheer intensity and impact of Season 1, I wondered — “Can they even follow this up?”</p>
      <p>But I hit play, with curiosity more than excitement.</p>

      <h3>A Colder, Quieter Tone</h3>
      <p>The first few episodes were quieter. Not slow — just… colder. The colors felt less saturated. The tension wasn’t about bullets or games — it was about what comes after you win something that should never be won. Gi-hun was rich, but he was empty. He walked like a man who was still inside the game, even though he was outside.</p>
      <p>I felt that. It’s like his soul never left the arena.</p>

      <h3>Gi-hun’s Numbness and Betrayal</h3>
      <p>One of the most haunting things about Season 2 was how numb Gi-hun had become. The money didn’t liberate him — it paralyzed him. Watching him ignore the ATM, live like a ghost, avoid his daughter… it was painful. And I kept asking myself: Isn’t this what he fought for? So why can’t he touch it?</p>
      <p>When he found out that the old man — Player 001 — had orchestrated everything, it broke something in me. The betrayal wasn’t just about being lied to. It was the fact that human suffering was just entertainment to someone who smiled through it all. The VIPs may have worn masks, but 001 smiled to his death with no mask at all. That felt cruel in a very intimate way.</p>

      <h3>The System Behind the Games</h3>
      <p>But what really made Season 2 interesting to me was the shift in tone. It wasn’t about the game anymore. It was about the system. The one that keeps people desperate, obedient, controllable. The one that lets monsters blend in, wear suits, and talk about fairness while orchestrating murder.</p>

      <h3>Gi-hun’s Decision: Refusing Freedom</h3>
      <p>Gi-hun’s decision to not get on that plane — to not go to his daughter — was the final twist. At first, I was angry. Why wouldn’t you walk away? You survived.</p>
      <p>But then I realized: he didn’t walk away because the game was still going on.</p>
      <p>Maybe not with guns and tiles… but with debt, fear, and silence.</p>
      <p>And so he dyed his hair red — not for fashion, but to rebel. He was no longer a player. He wanted to be a disruptor.</p>
      <p>And I didn’t know if that was wise… but I knew it was inevitable.</p>
      <p>I didn’t watch it like a new season. I didn’t feel a break. To me, it was one long echo — the sound of Gi-hun being pulled back into a place he never truly escaped.</p>

      <h3>The Return to the Underworld</h3>
      <p>It started with the airport. He was finally going to leave. To go see his daughter. A chance at peace.</p>
      <p>But that phone call — the voice — it wasn’t just bait. It was a reminder that the game never ended.</p>
      <p>And Gi-hun, who once clawed his way out, turned around. Walked away from his family, his flight, his freedom… not because he wanted revenge. But because he couldn’t ignore it anymore.</p>
      <p>The moment he changed his hair — dyed it red — I knew: he’s no longer the same man. He was tired of being a pawn. He wanted to flip the board.</p>
      <p>What followed was a slow, calculated dive back into the underworld. No begging this time. No naive curiosity. Gi-hun was now a man with intention.</p>

      <h3>The Evolved Game: Psychological Battles</h3>
      <p>But the game had evolved, too. It wasn’t just about innocent-looking arenas anymore. It was mind games, moral traps, layered deceptions.</p>
      <p>The guards had become colder. The design more complex. The stakes — psychological.</p>
      <p>I remember one particular challenge where choices were built into the game itself — nothing was random. The players weren’t just being tested physically. They were being watched for how they treat each other.</p>
      <p>Mercy became currency. Cruelty became strategy. And Gi-hun — he tried. He tried to hold onto his humanity.</p>
      <p>But you could see it: every decision etched onto his face. Every second of hesitation meant death for someone else.</p>
      <p>There was no clean win here. No honorable way through.</p>

      <h3>The Silent Moments</h3>
      <p>There were moments of quiet too — cruel, beautiful silences. Where characters stared at each other across the room, already knowing one of them won’t survive the next round. These scenes weren’t loud. They were the loudest in my head.</p>
      <p>And somewhere between those silences, we saw him changing. Gi-hun didn’t just want to survive anymore. He wanted to understand the system. And eventually, he wanted to break it.</p>
      <p>At one point, I stopped blinking. Not because of action or violence. But because of stillness.</p>
      <p>There was a scene where Gi-hun just sat there. Eyes forward. Silent. No words. No expression. And I thought, he’s already dead inside.</p>
      <p>The games didn’t kill him. Living through them did.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Final Rounds and Silence</h2>
      <p>The final few rounds blurred my reality. It didn’t feel like I was watching a show anymore — it felt like I was inside a cold psychological experiment, where everything that makes a human… human… was being peeled away.</p>
      <p>I still remember that room with the glass path. Each step forward meant trusting numbers. Or trusting someone. Or maybe just luck. One player tried to guess, slipped, screamed — and was gone. Just like that.</p>
      <p>The silence after each fall was louder than the fall itself.</p>
      <p>And Gi-hun? He didn’t cheer when he survived. He never did. He just breathed. That shallow, stunned kind of breathing — like you’re still alive, but you wish you weren’t.</p>
      <p>There was one moment — a conversation in the dorm, right before a brutal round — where a character asked Gi-hun why he keeps choosing to stay. And he didn’t answer. Because even he didn’t know anymore.</p>
      <p>I remember gripping the edge of my screen, literally. Like somehow I was part of it too.</p>

      <h3>The Final Challenge</h3>
      <p>And then came the final challenge. Just like the first, it looked simple. Childish. But by now, I knew — nothing in <em>Squid Game</em> is ever what it seems.</p>
      <p>The ground was soft with sand. The air felt heavier. Gi-hun wasn’t facing an opponent. He was facing everything that had changed inside him.</p>
      <p>Every choice. Every betrayal. Every moment he didn’t speak up. Every time he lived while someone else didn’t.</p>
      <p>There was a close-up on his face — and I swear, I saw a hundred emotions crash into his eyes at once.</p>
      <p>I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t want anyone to win anymore. I just wanted it to end.</p>
      <p>And when it did… There was no music. No applause. Just emptiness.</p>
      <p>Gi-hun walked away. Again. But something was different this time. He wasn’t broken. He was… awake.</p>

      <h3>The Final Blow</h3>
      <p>And then came the final blow. Just when I thought there would be peace — a narration began. Cold. Mechanical. Final.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>“Player 456, Eliminated.”</strong></blockquote>
      <p>I froze. What? This wasn’t a gunshot. This wasn’t blood. This was something worse.</p>
      <p>This was the end of identity. The wiping out of a soul. The declaration that Gi-hun, as a player, as a man, as the only one who remembered it all — was no longer needed.</p>
      <p>I didn’t move for a while. I sat there staring at the screen. And I whispered, “They actually did it.”</p>
      <p>They ended the game. And they ended him. Not with death. But with silence.</p>

      <p>I first noticed <em>Squid Game</em> popping up on Netflix sometime around 2021 or 2022. That now-iconic poster ‚Äî masked soldiers in pink suits ‚Äî was hard to miss. But honestly, I wasn‚Äôt tempted. It looked like a Korean twist on <em>Money Heist</em> at first glance, and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for what felt like another trendy imitation.</p>

      <p>It wasn‚Äôt until mid-2024 that I finally gave it a chance. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe I just wanted to understand the global obsession. So I hit <strong>Play</strong>. And I didn‚Äôt expect what followed: something this emotionally intense, visually strange, and <em>socially layered</em>.</p>

      <h2>2. The Start of the Game</h2>
      <p>One random day in 2024, I pressed play. I don‚Äôt even know why. Maybe it was just years of seeing that title float in my feed. Maybe I just gave in.</p>

      <p>The first few minutes felt like a typical Korean drama. A man falling apart. Gi-hun ‚Äî broke, divorced, barely holding on to his daughter, and gambling away what little he had left. The scenes were slow. Almost frustrating. Just a spiral of helplessness.</p>

      <p>Then the subway scene hit.</p>

      <p>A sharply dressed stranger approaches him with a game ‚Äî flipping paper tiles on the floor. I had never seen this before. Not in my childhood, not in my culture. But it was hypnotic. Every failed try came with a brutal slap. And the man taking those hits kept coming back.</p>

      <p><em>That slap wasn‚Äôt just pain ‚Äî it was the entry fee into something darker.</em></p>

      <h2>3. Red Light, Green Light</h2>
      <p>From the card to the van, then that white dorm full of strangers in green tracksuits ‚Äî I was fully in. The rules? Simple. The surroundings? Not so much. Everything felt like a <strong>twisted experiment</strong> in control.</p>

      <p>Then came the first game: <strong>Red Light, Green Light</strong>. And suddenly, everything changed.</p>

      <p>Gunshots. Panic. Blood. People collapsing in waves. But what shook me the most wasn‚Äôt the killing ‚Äî it was how <em>quickly</em> survival became strategy.</p>

      <p>This wasn‚Äôt a game about winning. It was about how broken the real world must be if this place felt like a better chance.</p>

      <p>The marbles round? Devastating. Trust shattered. Souls crushed. And that twist with Player 001‚Ä¶ hollowed me out completely.</p>

      <h2>üîç 4. Behind the Curtain</h2>
      <p>The VIPs. The masks. The "entertainment" angle. It made me feel like we‚Äôre all in some version of that game every day. Maybe not with bullets ‚Äî but with pressure, debt, and obedience.</p>

      <p>Gi-hun changed. Even when he walked out with the money ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt win. His soul had already been bled out.</p>

      <h2>5. No Break, Just Descent</h2>
      <p>I didn‚Äôt stop between seasons. It felt like one continuous spiral. Gi-hun never left the game ‚Äî not really. And when he walked away from that plane and dyed his hair red‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt drama. It was war.</p>

      <h2>6. Into the Game Again</h2>
      <p>He re-entered. Not as a player. As a disruptor.</p>

      <p>The new games were colder. Psychological. Designed to measure not just performance, but <strong>character</strong>. Mercy became a tactic. Cruelty, a shortcut.</p>

      <p>The silence before the rounds. The staring. The regrets. The weight of humanity shrinking down into every footstep on that glass path‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt look away.</p>

      <h2>7. The Final Rounds</h2>
      <p>The final round didn‚Äôt feel like a climax. It felt like a confession. Gi-hun didn‚Äôt face an opponent. He faced everything the system had turned him into.</p>

      <p>The expression on his face said everything. Rage, grief, guilt. And finally ‚Äî <em>clarity</em>.</p>

      <h2>8. The Elimination</h2>
      <p>He walked away once more. But this time, awake. Changed. Not broken ‚Äî but aware.</p>

      <blockquote>‚Äú<strong>Player 456, Eliminated.</strong>‚Äù</blockquote>

      <p>No gunshot. No blood. Just silence. The declaration that Gi-hun, the only one who remembered it all, was no longer needed.</p>

      <p>That line echoed in my mind for minutes.  
      Not because he died ‚Äî  
      But because he was <em>erased</em>.</p>
